# Bookworm Project

This project encompasses a web application focused on book sales.

## About the Project

The Book Sales Site project is an e-commerce platform that offers book lovers the opportunity to explore and purchase from a wide collection of books. The main objective of the project is to provide users with a rich experience concerning language options, payment methods, and secure shopping.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Language Support:** Users can choose between Turkish or English language options on the site. Translations can be easily done using the '@ngx-translate/core' npm package.

- **Variety of Books and Pricing:** The project offers a wide range of books in both Turkish and English languages. The price of each book is customized based on the language. Users are given the option to select the currency during the payment stage.
